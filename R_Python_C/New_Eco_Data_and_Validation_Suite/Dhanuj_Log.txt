Added Python Functionality in findvalidation for DBCV - DONE

Editing Estimate DC from DensityClust to include weights - DONE

Editing Densityclust else statement (r dist matrix passed in) for localdensity to include weights
        First editing Non Gaussian -DONE
        First editing Gaussian -DONE (check again for mathematical validity)

Weight Functionality is working!

Editing PlotMDS to scale points based on weights- DONE

NOTE# Need to fix DBCV, implement DBCV with weights, & change cluster center shape -> Uncorrected
