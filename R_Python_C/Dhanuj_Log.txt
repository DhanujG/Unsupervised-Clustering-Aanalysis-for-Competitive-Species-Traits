My log to keep track of completed tasks and tasks to complete

NOTE#  IMPLEMENTED 


Added Python Functionality in findvalidation for DBCV - DONE

Editing Estimate DC from DensityClust to include weights - DONE

Editing Densityclust else statement (r dist matrix passed in) for localdensity to include weights
        First editing Non Gaussian -DONE
        First editing Gaussian -DONE (check again for mathematical validity)

Weight Functionality is working!

Editing PlotMDS to scale points based on weights- DONE

DBCV fixed without weights- DONE

Cluster center shape turned into filled triangle with cross mark

DBCV implemented into regular cluster execution




NOTE#  TODO implement   

     
			DBCV with weights
			Fix plots in densityclust and execute 
			knn with weights 
			convert dbcv to c++
			convert density clust to main
			Wrap in Package
